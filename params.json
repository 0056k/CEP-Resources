{"name":"Adobe CEP Resources","tagline":"Getting Started with Adobe CEP","body":"Getting Started with the CC2014 Extension SDK\r\n==============\r\n\r\n(Page under construction)\r\nThis page provides resources you need to get started creating extensions for Adobe Creative Cloud 2014 applications, using the new HTML5/JavaScript interface model. The Flash/ActionScript interface model for extensions is no longer supported.\r\n\r\nExtensions and add-ins are built on the CEP 5 infrastructure and loaded with Extension Manager. Extensions that you build using these low-level tools must be packaged as ZXP files in order to be seen and loaded by Extension Manager. You can offer extensions as free or paid products through our marketing portals (Adobe Exchange, the Add-ins website, the Creative Cloud desktop app). When you do this, you upload the extension to Adobe as a single ZXP file. \r\n\r\nResources you will need include:\r\n* CEP JavaScript libraries for communicating  with the operating system and Extension Manager.\r\n* The Vulcan library for communicating wtih the host application and other extensions.\r\n* Sample code for how to use these libraries\r\n* The ZXP packager, a command-line utility\r\n\r\n(some of the documents provided here are in the process of being updated, and may not be entirely applicable)\r\n\r\n[CSInterface for CEP5](https://github.com/Adobe-CEP/JavaScript-API/blob/master/CSInterface.js)\r\n\r\n[CSInterface for CEP4.2](https://github.com/Adobe-CEP/JavaScript-API/blob/master/CSInterface-4.2.0.js)\r\n\r\n[CEPEngine Extension API spec (note, this file must NOT be included in an extension project as it is already integrated into CEP)](http://adobe.ly/1p2Onnl)\r\n\r\n[Vulcan for CEP5 (Communication API)](https://github.com/Adobe-CEP/CEP-Resources/blob/master/Vulcan.js)\r\n\r\n[Sample extensions](https://github.com/Adobe-CEP/Samples)\r\n\r\n[Offical documentation (for CEP 4.2)](http://adobe.ly/1cWBggl)\r\n\r\n[A short guide to HTML5 extensions (for CEP 4.0 but still mostly relevant)](http://adobe.ly/Nk1EK7)\r\n\r\n[Davide Barranca’s blog](http://bit.ly/Nk1Mta)\r\n\r\n[Extension Builder 3 Preview (Note, compatible with CEP 4.x only)](http://adobe.ly/1pho2QU)\r\n\r\n[David Deraedt’s plugin for Adobe Brackets](http://bit.ly/QKWWYL)\r\n\r\n[Adobe Exchange](http://bit.ly/1mHVksI)\r\n\r\n[The other API (Article on Medium)](http://bit.ly/1hIFZay)\r\n\r\n[Guide to signing extensions (valid for CEP 4.x and most likely CEP 5 as well)](http://bit.ly/1fARUZy)\r\n\r\n[Extension Builder 3 forums - get help from the developer community](http://adobe.ly/1mgZ2xe)\r\n\r\n[Nice tutorial (a bit old)](http://bit.ly/1nNLqH4)\r\n","google":"UA-33862654-2","note":"Don't delete this file!
